=== [jul.23] SDK upgrade ===
Updated to latest esp32 core Arduino (i.e 2.0.11)

=== Release 230528 / feature-NVSsensocampus
Bumps to esp32 2.0.9
Bumps to esp8266 3.1.2
- switch WiFi to both 802.11b AND 802.11g (DSI cut down 802.11b !!)
- esp8266 now features a configTzTime() that unifies NTP setup for both ESPs
- NVS WiFinamespace to save WiFi credentials (in order to avoid SPIFFS
	partitionning issues)
- NVS SENSOnamespace to sensOCampus credentials (MQTT creds)
- recompiled lwip for NTP server support from DHCP answer (IDF 4.4.4)


=== Release 221225 / backport-NVSnamespace
Note: temporary release only intended to neOSensors with FW <= 220815
Based on Release 220815 / esp32 2.0.4 (because later releases broke the SPIFFS partitioning)
- backport NVS namespace for WiFi credentials


=== [UNPUBLISHED] Release 230116 / feature-SDKupgrade
Bumps to esp32 2.0.6
Bumps to esp8266 3.1.0
- force 802.11b for both ESP8266 and ESP32 --> solved our DHCP issues :D
- WARNING: breaks SPIFFS format@ESP32 ==> reformat @ reboot ==> per device setup :'(
	(hopefully) no SPIFFS format change @ ESP8266
- WiFiManager 2.0.15-rc1 no debug --> revert to 2.0.14-beta
- newer WiFiManager introduces ASYNC SCAN ==> very slow (almost unanswered)
[esp32]
- recompiled lwip for NTP server support from DHCP answer (IDF 4.4.3)


=== Release 220815 / feature-SDKupgrade
Bumps to esp32 2.0.4
Bumps to esp8266 3.0.2
- we're still using the deprecated SPIFFS filesystem
- updated boards.local.txt
- _http_get now makes use of newer API involving a WIFIClient variable
- uniformized sntp includes for all ESP :)
- WIFImanager now used without mod
- switched noise ISR from ICACHE_RAM_ATTR to newer IRAM_ATTR
- improved NTP sync IPaddr used
[esp32]
- recompiled lwip for NTP server support from DHCP answer (IDF 4.4.2)
[esp8266]
- analogWrite now makes use of analogWriteRange set to 1023 to match previous
defaults
- setting up defaults partitionning IRAM to 32kb (defaults) in
boards.local.txt


=== Release 220328
- save WiFi credentials even if wrongly typed or end device has not been able
to connect to WiFi gateway

=== Changes prior to 2022
 * F.Thiebolt   nov.21  corrected timezone definition for esp32
 *						added support for various serial sensors like PMSx003, SDS011 and IKEA Vindriktning :D
 *						added support for digital inputs (PIR & switches)
 *						introduced the cooldown approach and data integration
 *						... means that we'll only send data when they differ from the previously sent
 * F.Thiebolt   sep.21  added display module support (e.g oled or 7segment displays)
 * F.Thiebolt   aug.21  started digital inputs support (e.g PIR sensor)
 *                      added support for shared JSON document for data exchange
 *                      between modules
 * F.Thiebolt	apr.21	added support for 3 NTP servers + NTP from DHCP to lwip
 *						Have a look to `arduinoIDE_esp32_boards/README.md`
 * F.Thiebolt   aug.20  initial port from neOSensor based on ESP8266
 *                      added esp32 adc calibration support
 *                      setupNTP called AFTER network setup
 * 						new definition board for neOSensor-AirQuality board
 *						added definition board for (future) neOSensor esp32 based board\
 *						added suppport for boards configuration via sensOCampus JSON config\
 *						added Arduino IDE support for our various neOSensor boards
