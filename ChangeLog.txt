Bumps to esp32 2.0.9
Bumps to esp8266 3.1.2
- switch WiFi to both 802.11b AND 802.11g (DSI cut down 802.11b !!)
- esp8266 now features a configTzTime() that unifies NTP setup for both ESPs
- make use of NVS namespace to save WiFi crdentials (in order to avoid SPIFFS
	partitionning issues)
- recompiled lwip for NTP server support from DHCP answer (IDF 4.4.4)


=== Release 230116 / feature-SDKupgrade
Bumps to esp32 2.0.6
Bumps to esp8266 3.1.0
- force 802.11b for both ESP8266 and ESP32 --> solved our DHCP issues :D
- WARNING: breaks SPIFFS format@ESP32 ==> reformat @ reboot ==> per device setup :'(
	(hopefully) no SPIFFS format change @ ESP8266
- WiFiManager 2.0.15-rc1 no debug --> revert to 2.0.14-beta
- newer WiFiManager introduces ASYNC SCAN ==> very slow (almost unanswered)
