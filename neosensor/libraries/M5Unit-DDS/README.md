# M5Unit-DDS

## Overview

### SKU:U105

DDS is a signal source Unit. It uses the AD9833 programmable waveform generator + STM32F0 micro controller. Based on I2C communication interface (addr:0x31) It can easily control the signal source to output multiple waveforms (sine wave, triangle wave, square wave output, sawtooth wave, signal output amplitude 0-0.6V) and adjust the frequency and phase.

It supports deep sleep mode, which can reduce the power consumption in the idle state. The Unit is suitable for the electronic circuit prototype design of various test instruments as a signal source.
