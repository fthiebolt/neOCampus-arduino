# M5Unit-RELAY

### 4RELAY

4-Relay unit is an integrated 4-way relay module which can be controlled by I2C protocol. The maximum control voltage of each relay is AC-250V/DC-28V, the rated current is 10A and the instantaneous current can hold up to 16A. Each relay can be controlled independently, each on it's own. Each relay has status (LED) indictor as well to show the state of the relay at any given time.

### 2RELAY

2-Channel SPST Relay Unit is a 2-channel SPST relay module, equipped with two high-current relays that work under AC250V 8A or DC28V 8A. Each relay adopts independent IO control, and status indicator LED. It is suitable for home appliance power control, or ON/OFF switch for industrial equipment.

### RELAY

RELAY as it says is an M5Unit that implement a Relay functions. Relay can be used as an electrically operated switch, uses an electromagnet to mechanically operate a switch, where it is necessary to control a large power load circuit by a separate low-power signal such as digital signal output from a microprocessor.
